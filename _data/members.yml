  description: "Yes-Associated Protein (YAP) is a largely intrinsically disordered protein that undergoes liquid-liquid phase separation in response to environmental changes such as crowding or pH. YAP also functions as an interaction hub for other proteins such as TEAD, LATS1/2, and TAZ. We are interested to see how changes in solution environment affect structure, function, and selectivity of proteins recruited into YAP droplets."

  description: "The goal of my project is to engineer an automated open Source pipette and microscopy platform, via the combination of an Opentrons OT-2 with a Zeiss inverted microscope. This will give the lab access to a fully automated system to do both media perturbations and imaging simultaneously, which will enable precise and reproduceable experiments."
  fact: "I like to build and paint models in my free time."
