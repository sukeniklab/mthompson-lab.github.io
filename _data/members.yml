  description: "The goal of my project is to engineer an automated open Source pipette and microscopy platform, via the combination of an Opentrons OT-2 with a Zeiss inverted microscope. This will give the lab access to a fully automated system to do both media perturbations and imaging simultaneously, which will enable precise and reproduceable experiments."
  fact: "I like to build and paint models in my free time."
