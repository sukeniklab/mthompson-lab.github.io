<h2>The Sukenik lab is interested in how the cellular environment affects biomolecular function</h2>

<p>Temperature is a key variable that governs the behavior of microscopic systems. 
Contrary to this knowledge, techniques that provide the vast majority of high-resolution 
structural information about biological macromolecules, including traditional X-ray crystallography 
and cryoEM, are typically performed using cryogenically preserved samples, in order to minimize 
the effects of radiation damage. While traditional experiments provide a wealth of structural 
information about low-energy conformations, cryocooling can bias conformational ensembles and 
obscure information about fluctuations away from the lowest energy states, which are often critical 
for function under physiological conditions.</p>

<p><em>We seek to develop and apply new tools for structural biology that overcome this limitation.</em></p>

<h2>Our lab has been concentrating effort on several specific problems:</h2>

<h3>The effects of metabolic rewiring on protein function</h3>

</div>
</div>

<div class="row">
<div class="7u 12u$(small)">

<p>A significant amount of energy is spent by our cells to maintain a stable and optimal physical-chemical intracellular environment, a process collectively referred to as homeostasis. Yet in certain situations where the cellâ€™s pathways are systematically reprogrammed, homeostasis can break down, causing a change in cellular pH, osmotic pressure, small molecule concentrations, and even the water contents of cells. Remarkably, this intracellular change, often referred to as metabolic rewiring, is common in many pathological conditions including viral infection and most types of cancer cells. How metabolic rewiring affects proteins, the molecular machines that power nearly all cellular functions, is central to understanding how cancer and other metabolically linked pathologies develop. </p>

<h3>Regulation of intrinsicallty disordered proteins by the cellular environment</h3>

<div class="8u 12u$(small)">

<p> The cellular environment is dynamic and heterogeneous in both space and time, and far removed from the idealized buffers commonly used in biochemistry experiments. How proteins function in this environment is a fundamental question in biology that is poorly understood. Especially puzzling are intrinsically disordered proteins, which make up over 30% of the human proteome and play a disproportionately large role in cellular regulation and misregulation. Intrinsically disordered proteins have large surface areas and a low number of intramolecular bonds, making them highly susceptible to changes in solution composition. Why have these proteins evolved to be central hubs and regulators of cellular function when routine cell cycle changes can alter their activity? Our lab aims to understand how disordered proteins function and interact in the complex cellular environment, and how the chemical composition of this environment can act as a master regulator that tunes their function.  </p>
